Small web app coded for personal use.

It is minimal. Credentials are hardcoded, which I can do as I don't intend to expand. The database only has one table, one field and one row. There's also no way for a user to directly interact directly with the database, there's just a function to change the date to today's date. All of this combined leads me to believe that it is a pretty robust app security-wise.

Any feedback or questions feel free to message me on Twitter/X at CyberSecHell.
